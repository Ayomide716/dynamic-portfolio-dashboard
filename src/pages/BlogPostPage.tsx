        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Building scalable React applications requires careful planning, proper architecture, and adherence to best practices. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the key strategies and patterns that will help you create maintainable and scalable React applications.</p>
        
        <h2>Project Structure</h2>
        <p>A well-organized project structure is the foundation of any scalable application. Here's a recommended structure:</p>
        <pre><code>src/
  components/
    ui/
    common/
    feature-specific/
  pages/
  hooks/
  utils/
  types/
  store/
  styles/</code></pre>
        
        <h2>Component Architecture</h2>
        <p>When building components for large applications, consider these principles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Single Responsibility:</strong> Each component should have one clear purpose</li>
          <li><strong>Composition over Inheritance:</strong> Use composition to build complex UIs</li>
          <li><strong>Props Interface:</strong> Define clear TypeScript interfaces for all props</li>
          <li><strong>Error Boundaries:</strong> Implement error boundaries to handle failures gracefully</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>State Management</h2>
        <p>For large applications, consider using state management solutions like Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or React Query for server state. Keep local state minimal and lift state up only when necessary.</p>
        
        <h2>Performance Optimization</h2>
        <p>Key performance considerations include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Code splitting with React.lazy() and Suspense</li>
          <li>Memoization with React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback</li>
          <li>Virtual scrolling for large lists</li>
          <li>Image optimization and lazy loading</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Testing Strategy</h2>
        <p>Implement a comprehensive testing strategy with unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Use tools like Jest, React Testing Library, and Cypress.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Building scalable React applications is a journey that requires continuous learning and adaptation. By following these best practices and staying updated with the latest developments in the React ecosystem, you'll be well-equipped to handle projects of any size.</p>

        <h2>The Performance Imperative</h2>
        <p>In today's fast-paced digital world, performance is not just a nice-to-haveâ€”it's essential. Users expect applications to load quickly and respond instantly to their interactions.</p>
        
        <h2>Core Web Vitals</h2>
        <p>Google's Core Web Vitals provide key metrics for measuring user experience:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):</strong> Measures loading performance</li>
          <li><strong>First Input Delay (FID):</strong> Measures interactivity</li>
          <li><strong>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):</strong> Measures visual stability</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Frontend Optimization Techniques</h2>
        <h3>Code Splitting</h3>
        <p>Break your application into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand:</p>
        <pre><code>const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./LazyComponent'));

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;Suspense fallback={&lt;div&gt;Loading...&lt;/div&gt;}&gt;
      &lt;LazyComponent /&gt;
    &lt;/Suspense&gt;
  );
}</code></pre>
        
        <h3>Image Optimization</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use modern image formats (WebP, AVIF)</li>
          <li>Implement lazy loading for images</li>
          <li>Serve responsive images with srcset</li>
          <li>Optimize image dimensions and compression</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Bundle Optimization</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tree shaking to eliminate dead code</li>
          <li>Minimize and compress JavaScript and CSS</li>
          <li>Use dynamic imports for route-based code splitting</li>
          <li>Implement proper caching strategies</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Runtime Performance</h2>
        <h3>React Optimization</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Use React.memo for expensive components</li>
          <li>Implement useMemo and useCallback for expensive calculations</li>
          <li>Optimize re-renders with proper state structure</li>
          <li>Use React DevTools Profiler to identify bottlenecks</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Virtual Scrolling</h3>
        <p>For large datasets, implement virtual scrolling to render only visible items:</p>
        <pre><code>import { FixedSizeList as List } from 'react-window';

const VirtualizedList = ({ items }) => (
  &lt;List
    height={600}
    itemCount={items.length}
    itemSize={50}
  &gt;
    {({ index, style }) => (
      &lt;div style={style}&gt;
        {items[index]}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    )}
  &lt;/List&gt;
);</code></pre>
        
        <h2>Network Optimization</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Implement service workers for caching</li>
          <li>Use CDNs for static assets</li>
          <li>Enable gzip/brotli compression</li>
          <li>Minimize HTTP requests</li>
          <li>Use HTTP/2 for improved multiplexing</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Monitoring and Measurement</h2>
        <p>Use tools like Lighthouse, WebPageTest, and real user monitoring (RUM) to continuously track performance and identify areas for improvement.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Performance optimization is an ongoing process that requires attention to detail and continuous monitoring. By implementing these techniques and staying updated with the latest best practices, you can ensure your applications provide excellent user experiences.</p>
